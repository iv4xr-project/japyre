        A command is a pair (cmd,arg) where
        cmd is a string specifying the command name, and arg is a Json-string

        The function f attached in self.command-interpreter is used to interpret
        incoming commands. Upon receiving
        a pair (cmd,arg) from the client, f(cmd,arg) is invoked. The function is
        assumed to produce a Json-string, which is then sent back to the client.
